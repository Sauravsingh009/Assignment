        "Answer:1. Variable Names Should Be Descriptive and Meaningful:\n",
        "\n",
        "Choose names that clearly indicate the purpose or content of the variable.\n",
        "For example, customer_name is more informative than cn.\n",
        "2. Use Snake Case for Variable Names:\n",
        "\n",
        "Snake case involves writing variable names in lowercase with words separated by underscores ( _ ).\n",
        "This is the preferred style for variable names in Python.\n",
        "Example: total_amount, items_in_cart.\n",
        "3. Variable Names Should Start with a Letter or Underscore:\n",
        "\n",
        "They cannot begin with a number.\n",
        "Example: _count is valid, but 123count is not.\n",
        "4. Avoid Using Reserved Keywords:\n",
        "\n",
        "Reserved keywords have predefined meanings in Python. Using them as variable names can lead to errors.\n",
        "Examples of reserved keywords: if, else, for, while, True, False, etc.\n",
        "If you accidentally use a reserved word, you might get a SyntaxError: invalid syntax error.\n",
        "5. Variable Names Are Case-Sensitive:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_variable and My_Variable are considered different variables.\n",
        "6. Constants Are Typically Written in Uppercase:\n",
        "\n",
        "Constants are values that are not intended to be changed during the program's execution.\n",
        "They are usually written in all uppercase with words separated by underscores.\n",
        "Example: MAX_VALUE, PI.\n",
        "7. Declare Variables Before Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "Before using a variable, assign it a value. This helps prevent errors and improves code clarity.\n",
        "Example demonstrating a few conventions:\n",

Instead, the interpreter determines the data type during runtime based on the value assigned to the variable. This allows variables to hold different types of data throughout the program's execution."
